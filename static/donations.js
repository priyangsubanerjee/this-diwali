      "Nilay Agarwal (30) started Vishalakshi Foundation after his friend Vishalakshi died in a car accident in 2018. This life-changing incident prompted the youngster to invest his time towards a noble cause. The NGO works towards feeding the poor and teaching children living in slums. Nilay says that the focus is on education right now under their ‘Project Dream School’. From setting up one school in a slum in June 2020, they are running 17 such schools across the country today, educating more than 2,000 children.",

      "Growing up in Bijanbari village, Darjeeling, Roshni Pradhan would observe that children of tea estate workers didn’t go to schools. One of the reasons was the poor infrastructure or absence of teachers. So she started teaching these children at their homes and later, as the numbers increased, at their schools. She found that football was a good way to help the children improve their skills.",
